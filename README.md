# Berry Bubble CS Platform
The goal of this project is to create a networking platform for Berry College Computer Science students and alumni to showcase their work, portfolios, LinkedIn profiles, and resumes, while fostering connections within the community. As the CS program at Berry College continues to expand, this platform will highlight the dedication, creativity, and achievements of its members, promoting a sense of unity and collaboration.

By bringing together the accomplishments and experiences of both current students and alumni, the platform will serve as a source of inspiration and a valuable resource. It is my hope that this resource will encourage students to push their boundaries, innovate, and grow.

Ultimately, the platform aims to bridge the gap between students and alumni, facilitating meaningful connections that offer insights, guidance, and opportunities to support their career journeys in Computer Science.
